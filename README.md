# JavaScript Test Website

---

### Purpose:

The purpose of this website is to help me develop and allow other people to contribute to javascript skills. The goal is to test new Javascript skills and see what we can do. From small things to possibly something big. My goal is to use anything BUT PHP.

### Specifications

The server this website is hosted on is running ubuntu 22.04 with apache 2. If you any ideas and would like to contribute, please make an issue and assign yourself to it, comment, and I will review it. No real goal in mind, so if you have one as well for a blank Non-PHP website, please leave a comment as well. This is the only source of documentation. website will be hosted at https://jstest.logandag.dev

## All content will be screened for any security issues before being uploaded to the server.
